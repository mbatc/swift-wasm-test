# Swift WASM Test

This repo contains a test web page that hosts the [Swift Robotics Simulator](https://github.com/jhavl/swift) entirely within a browser. The swift python package is cross-compiled to Web Assembly with [Emscripten Forge](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/recipes) and loaded in the browser using [Empack](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/empack) and [PyJS](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/pyjs.git). The Swift python package did have to be modified to work in the Web environment as it spun up both a WebSocket server and HTTP server internally. Additionally, the [React-Swift](https://github.com/jhavl/react-swift.git) page needed to be modified to account for these changes. The modifications are described later in this document.

## Setup

Setting up the repo involves setting paths to dependencies, cloning dependencies, and creating conda environments used during the build process. The [setup.sh](scripts/setup.sh) implements this. Build settings such as dependency paths are stored in the `./swift-wasm-test/conf` folder to be used by other scripts.

```sh
# Dependencies needed for setup process
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install lbzip2

# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/mbatc/swift-wasm-test.git

# Install micromamba (if you haven't already)
"${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh)
# You'll need to restart your terminal after installing micromamba

# Run the swift-wasm-test setup script to clone dependencies and setup
# environments used for building the site. If using custom paths for cloned repos
# '~' does not work correctly. You must enter the entire path.
./swift-wasm-test/scripts/setup.sh
```

## Building

Once the project has been setup by running the [setup.sh](scripts/setup.sh) script. You can build everything by running the [build.sh](scripts/build.sh)

```sh
./swift-wasm-test/scripts/build.sh
```

The key steps performed by the build script are,

### 1. Export swift recipe.yaml

The [template recipe](recipes/swift-sim/recipe.yaml.in) (recipe.yaml.in) is exported to `recipes/swift-sim/recipe.yaml` with the `SWIFT_DIR` and `BUILD_NUMBER` variables evaluated. This maps the source path to the local `Swift` repository configure in Setup, and increments the build number in the recipe so that the new package is installed correctly later in the build process.

### 2. Build swift python package

Using the recipe exported in the previous step, `builder.py` from [Emscripten Forge](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/recipes.git) is used to build the Swift python package.

This step is performed within the `emscripten-forge` conda environment.

### 3. Build react-swift

The build script installs react-swift dependencies and builds the package using using npm. I've found that node v16 is the most compatible with Swift. This is installed to the `react-swift` environment during setup.

This step is performed within the `react-Swift` conda environment.

### 3. Build next-swift

This step runs the build procesd for `next-swift` which exports the react app as a static html page the the `swift/out` folder the Swift repository.

For this step, the `NEXT_SWIFT_BASE_PATH` environment variable is used in `next.config.js` to override the base path of the exported site. If the web page is not hosted on the root of the server, then you may need to set this to the prefix used in the URL. For example, the github.io page would use `NEXT_SWIFT_BASE_PATH=/swift-wasm-test/swift`

This step is performed within the `react-Swift` conda environment.

### 4. Install Swift and Pack Web Environment

This step installs the Swift python package, `swift-sim` to the web environment and then uses `empack` to export the web environment to the `./dist` directory.

The web page in [site](./site/) and next-swift built in the previous step are then copied to `./dist`. The `dist` folder is then ready to be hosted on a server.

## Swift Modifications

The desktop verison of Swift has two components. [Swift](https://github.com/jhavl/swift) (a desktop python package) and [React-Swift](https://github.com/jhavl/react-swift) (a user interface implemented as a React web app). Swift simulates the environment and React-Swift draws the simulation allowing you to interact with it. The main challenges were related to getting these two components to communicate. The desktop implementation uses technologies that arenâ€™t available in Web Assembly. For example, Swift spins up a HTTP server to host the React Swift user interface, a Web Socket Server is used to send messages between the simulation and the user interface, and there are additional challenges accessing assets which would usually be read directly from the users hard-drive.

Swift supports two communication models: Web Sockets, and RTC. For WebAssembly an additional communication model was implemented based on [PyJS](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/pyjs.git). PyJS is a Python <=> JavaScript foreign function interface that is part of [Emscripten Forge](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/recipes). The communication model was implementing by exposing hooks from the Python module, which can be called from JavaScript running in the browser. These hooks are used to set up callbacks that handle messages. At this stage, the messages use the exact same format as the Web Sockets communications model, so only minor modifications were needed on the JavaScript side.

Once the dependency on Web Sockets was removed the Swift python package was cross compiled to Web Assembly using [Emscripten Forge](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/recipes). Then to avoid starting a HTTP server, the Web Interface is hosted alongside the web page that loads the WASM version of Swift. This allows Swift to load the user interface in an iframe element on the web page. The user interface still needs to be hosted by a server, but we can take advantage of the fact that Swift is now being loaded in a web environment to do this.

In the original architecture, the User Interface fetches 3D models from the HTTP server hosted by Swift. Importantly, these requests were handled by a custom request handler which would load the file from the python packages data. Now that we aren't implementing the HTTP server, a different approach is needed. When a 3D model is requested, we need to load the file from Emscriptens virtual file system instead. This was achieved by using the `URL.createObjectURL` method to register asset data with the browser. Then we simply override the URL passed to the model importers to load 3D models correctly.
